<h1 align="center">axiograph</h1>

<h5 align="center">A Rust program that visualizes the structure of complex axioms using GPT-4. Give it an axiom and a "depth", and it will generate a summary based on all established sub-axioms and a graph using graphviz. Explore the relationships between axioms and gain new insights with ease.</h5>
