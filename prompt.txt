I want you to write three connected and related and semantically relevant axioms to the axiom: "The banana is curved."

You must respond with nothing but syntactically correct JSON matching the format of the following example:

Example:

[
      "The invasion was based on the belief that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction.",
      "The invasion was controversial and sparked widespread protests and opposition.",
      "The invasion led to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime."
]
